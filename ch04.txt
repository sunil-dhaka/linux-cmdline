## mkdir to make nested direcs

Exa:

mkdir -p I/want/to/make/sigle/thread/nested/dirs
```
└── want
    └── to
        └── make
            └── sigle
                └── thread
                    └── nested
                        └── dirs
```

mkdir -p I/{want,to/{make,multiple/{thread,nested/dirs}}}
```
├── to
│   ├── make
│   └── multiple
│       ├── nested
│       │   └── dirs
│       └── thread
└── want
```

mkdir -p I/{want/{beep,boop/foo},also-want/{deep,doop/foo{tap,map}}}
```
├── also-want
│   ├── deep
│   └── doop
│       ├── foomap
│       └── footap
└── want
    ├── beep
    └── boop
        └── foo

```

mkdir -p I/{want/{beep,boop/foo},also-want/{deep,doop/foo/{tap,map}}}

```
├── also-want
│   ├── deep
│   └── doop
│       └── foo
│           ├── map
│           └── tap
└── want
    ├── beep
    └── boop
        └── foo
```

## copy files
flag options with cp:

-i --interactive
-r --recursive //for dirs
-v --verbose //show what shit is being done to my pc
-u --update //only move that don't exist or are newer than previous ::::::::

exa:
cp -i file1[exists] file2
cp -v dir1/* dir2 //all from dir1 goes to dir2

## move or rename
same options

-i --interactive
-r --recursive //for dirs
-v --verbose //show what shit is being done to my pc
-u --update //only move that don't exist ::::::::


++++++++++++
Here is a useful tip: Whenever you use wildcards with rm (besides carefully
checking your typing!), test the wildcard first with ls. This will let you see the
files that will be deleted. Then press the up arrow key to recall the command
and replace the ls with rm.

## hard and soft{sym} links
++++++++++
this is a bit new topic practice this part again after some days, to recall and rewrite in your hard-drive:)
++++++++++

ln file1 file1-hard

ln -s file1 file1-symbolic
